            <div class="text">Iâ€™ve long had a passion for art and visual design, as well as helping small businesses 
                grow. As someone who operates their own small business, I firmly believe in one has a 
                duty in supporting their communities comprised of other exceptional small businesses; 
                lifting one another up by leveraging our unique services and professional prowess is 
                the foremost reason I take such pride and enjoyment in my work.
